Title - Analyzing Precipitation Data For Buffalo and San Diego
Overview - Using R to analyze precipitation data for Buffalo and San Diego and using statistical methods to apply analysis to predicting future precipitation rates in both cities.
Methods - Using r commands to organize data and the hist command to create histograms. Utilizing Z-value formula and Normal Distribution Table to calculate probabilities.
Key Findings - Probability that rain in Buffalo will be below 4 inches is around 28.10%. Probability that rain in Buffalo will be over 42 inches is around 28.20%. Probability that rain in San Diego will be less than 4 inches is about 3.5%. Probability that rain in San Diego will be between 4 and 10 inches is about 57%.
Tools - R Studio
Reflection - This was a good exercise to learn and get used to R and its commands. It's nice to learn how to generate graphs, make variables to make the coding easier, learn how to input data and analyze said data with R, and how to do some statistical calculations within R. I definitely feel as if there are more commands and functions to learn within R because I would take roundabout ways to achieving some of the calculations I had done. I look forward to learning and using R more.
